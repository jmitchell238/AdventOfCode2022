--- Day 1: Historian Hysteria ---

The Chief Historian is always present for the big Christmas sleigh launch, but nobody has seen him 
in months! Last anyone heard, he was visiting locations that are historically significant to the 
North Pole; a group of Senior Historians has asked you to accompany them as they check the places 
they think he was most likely to visit.

As each location is checked, they will mark it on their list with a star. They figure the Chief 
Historian must be in one of the first fifty places they'll look, so in order to save Christmas, you 
need to help them get fifty stars on their list before Santa takes off on December 25th.

Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent 
calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first. Each puzzle grants one star. 
Good luck!

You haven't even left yet and the group of Elvish Senior Historians has already hit a problem: 
their list of locations to check is currently empty. Eventually, someone decides that the best 
place to check first would be the Chief Historian's office.

Upon pouring into the office, everyone confirms that the Chief Historian is indeed nowhere to be 
found. Instead, the Elves discover an assortment of notes and lists of historically significant 
locations! This seems to be the planning the Chief Historian was doing before he left. Perhaps 
these notes can be used to determine which locations to search?

Throughout the Chief's office, the historically significant locations are listed not by name but by 
a unique number called the location ID. To make sure they don't miss anything, The Historians split 
into two groups, each searching the office and trying to create their own complete list of location 
IDs.

There's just one problem: by holding the two lists up side by side (your puzzle input), it quickly 
becomes clear that the lists aren't very similar. Maybe you can help The Historians reconcile their 
lists?

For example:

1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet

In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are 12, 38, 15, and 77. Adding these together produces 142.

Consider your entire calibration document. What is the sum of all of the calibration values?

--- Part Two ---

Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually spelled out with letters:
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, and nine also count as valid "digits".

Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:

two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen

In this example, the calibration values are 29, 83, 13, 24, 42, 14, and 76. Adding these together produces 281.

What is the sum of all of the calibration values?
